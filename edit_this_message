"? This message is being sent solely based on our match percentage. Good work. Maybe we should be pen pals, as in with pen and papers and stamps and stuff.\n\nSincerely James.\n\nSIDENOTE: This message was sent by scraping your username from my top percentage hyper-matches. Uh... in the pursuit of an absurd perfection and techno fabricated 'love' encounter I took the liberty to scream into the void. This would indicate that perhaps we answered enough questions we would be compatible and could maybe laugh together. I probably did not read your profile, but would like to have a reason to other than uh ... *long dramatic pause* ... Sorry. My thought was that having a high percentage would be enough to find your attention and entice you to get to know me. Well anyways, toodles. As christopher wool once said, \"cats/inbag/bags/in/river\" Also if you are a young dapper professional type I really want to say just completely disregard this message, because I don't play big people dress up, but what I should say is its okay someone has to do it right *wink* *wink*. Not being snarky, just sincere. Thnx. I'm serious about that pen pal thing,  although I suppose if we are in the same are area we could theoretically meet up. \n\n TL;DR. \"nerdy-artist\" just doing research."
